## Overview
For the longest time, Burger King has been one of the top fast-food restaurants in the country. However, today, that is not the case.  Since the opening of the fast-food chain in 1954, Burger King has been trying to differentiate itself from its competitors. Their key factor being the flame broiler they love to tout. In the case study done by Laura Heely, it states, “[u]nsatisfied with traditional broilers on the market, James W. McLamore and David Edgerton, invented Burger King’s famous flame broiler…” (2018, p. 5). The founders saw an opening in the market of the fast-food industry with something that makes them different. Burger King has always tried to better its position in the market. An article from Business Insider states, “In 1979, former McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith introduced the new menu items as well as signature burgers in a strategy to target older customers who were willing to spend a little more on quality food” (McDowell 2020). Burger King has tried to incorporate new things in order to come out on top in the fast-food race. Even though they do this, they still seem to be failing. In an article published by Geekspin, Saclao states, “Burger King, which held the second spot in last year’s ranking, is now down to sixth” (Saclao 2021). This fact shows just how much they have fallen, and this wasn’t the only time it lost the number 2 spot. In the case study, Heely states that it lost the number spot to Wendy’s back in 2012 (2018). Burger King needs to do something soon to come back from this loss.
## The Problem
There is a minutia of problems that led to Burger King’s downfall; however, the most important problem that Burger King is facing is bad positioning. There were two key factors that led to Burger King’s bad positioning. The first key factor was the growing health concerns surrounding fast-food in general. With the power of the internet, people can now look up exactly how bad fast-food is for their health and there is a plethora of people who refuse to eat fast-food because of that. As Heely states in the article, “Google’s autocomplete search predictions for ‘fast food is’ included ‘bad’, ‘unhealthy’, and ‘killing us’, indicating that many searches were using these key words” (2018, p. 4). With the amount of people searching for this, it is no surprise that there would be more hesitance towards fast-food. An article published by CNN states, “Fast foods tend to be high in calories, fat, salt and sugar, which -- when consumed in excess -- can be associated with obesity, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, among other health risks” (2018). With this information readily available for people online, it will cause people to try to look for healthier options. Most fast-food companies have already implemented healthier options in their menus (salads, vegan patties, etc.). However, they should do more than just add items to their menu. The growing health concerns reflect poorly on the brand mantra McLamore, and Edgerton strived for. Burger King must make changes to its food in order to keep its brand mantra of high quality flame-broiled burgers.
The second key factor that led to Burger King’s bad positioning was its edgy creative advertising.  Since the early 2000s, Burger King has been producing advertisements that were “quirky and playful” (Heely, 2018, p. 6). Although their campaigns were initially received well, Burger King began to push boundaries and made poor sponsor decisions. A great example of this is when Burger King decided to pay $1 million for the King to appear alongside Floyd Mayweather’s entourage during Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao’s boxing match. In the article published by Business Insider, McDowell states, “…publicity was largely negative due to the fact that Mayweather had pleaded guilty to domestic abuse charges and had spent time in jail” (2020). This isn’t the only occasion where Burger King was in hot waters. Many people were disturbed with Burger King’s mascot, the King. In the case study, Heely states, “Those who weren’t offended sometimes found the King creepy…the King was named by Time Magazine as one of the 10 creepiest product mascots…” (2018, p. 6). It was clear that these choices were damaging to Burger King’s brand. If the main characteristics for people’s frame of reference for Burger King is a creepy mascot and, quality lacking, unhealthy food, then people will not want to go to Burger King to eat. Burger King must make changes to stay afloat or else it runs the risk of losing its top ten position in the country.   
## Evaluation of Alternative Solutions
The only viable solution to Burger King’s problems is to implement a new positioning strategy, and the case study gives us 5 positioning strategies that Burger King could implement (Healthy, Premium, Core, Affordable, New parts of the day). Out of these 5 positioning strategies the best option for Burger King is to mix the positioning strategies premium and core. They should ensure that the taste and quality of the Core food items are consistent. Heely states that the Core positioning strategy involves “focus[ing] on its core menu items (the Whopper, fries, Chicken fries) …to (re)capture young, male ‘super-fan’ segment – the 18-34-year-old males…who eat fast-food on a nearly daily basis.” (2018, p. 8). Focusing on the demographic that eats the most fast-food makes sense because that would be the best way for Burger King to get more people to eat at their restaurants. Its main differentiator is its famous flame-broiler. If they advertise how their burgers are made quality and not fixate on ridiculous ads, then they can convey that their brand mantra is high quality flame-broiled burgers. Burger King’s Whopper is already well known and can be improved upon. Advertising how the Whopper is made and how it compares to its competitors would be a good way to show off the brand. Incorporating the Premium positioning also makes sense when trying to show the quality of their flame-broiler. In the case study, Heely states that the Premium positioning strategy involves “leverag[ing] its BBQ origins and position itself as a premium burger chain to compete with Five Guys and Shake Shack. A new broiler system has been already rolled out, allowing for introduction of premium items…” (2018, p.8). Most people do not see five guys and shake shack as “fast food. When you walk into a Five Guys, you see the employees grilling the patties on a flat top grill. Everything they do the burger is laid out to bare. They are confident that the food you will receive is made with quality. Aligning itself with competitors like Five Guys and Shake Shack shows that Burger King does not think of itself as a fast-food restaurant rather a high quality burger joint.
 
## Managerial Recommendations
The best way for Burger King to position itself as a high quality burger joint that also focuses on its core products is to conduct a social media marketing campaign to illustrate the quality that flame-broiled burgers do provide because their target market should be the 18-35 year old males, since they eat most fast-food on a daily basis. People are engaged with social media more than ever, especially those in this age demographic. In an article published by Pew Research Center, Brooke Auxier and Monica Anderson state, “roughly seven-in-ten Americans say they…use [some] kind of social media site” (2021). Burger King has already done some social media campaigns, and some have been successful. In the age of social media, Burger King’s main partners for their marketing campaigns should be social media influencers. For example, back in 2019, Burger King ran a campaign of liking people’s old tweets (Penfold, 2019) and then tweeted “some things from 2010 are worth revisiting-like your old tweets. and Funnel Cake Fries. get them now for a limited time” (Burger King). This marketing campaign caught the attention of Casey Neistat, a famous YouTuber. In an article written by Katie Penfold, she states, “Escalating the campaign even further, Casey Neistat…posted a video on his channel jokingly blasting the restaurant chain for manipulating influencers into promoting its fries” (2019). That video has over 3 million views and garnered enough attention to cause Burger King to respond. This exchange with Neistat and Burger King brought a lot of publicity to both of them. Penfold explains it best as, “either way it was a highly impactful piece of influencer marketing that certainly got people talking”, which is important because, as soon as one is in the public’s conscientious, it can lead to increase in brand awareness. Burger King should be creating more social media campaigns that partner with influencers because, right now, those individuals are always being written about. Burger King does not have to make it a paid promotion, as seen with the Neistat situation, just responding to influencers causes some attraction to the brand. This can bring back many customers in the target age to look at what Burger King is doing. Burger King can do videos with influencers doing taste tests and how the flame-broiled burgers taste better. Focusing on the whopper and how with the new broiler system enhances the flavor. Social media influence can bring a multitude of customers, including those in the target audience, to come and eventually put Burger King back to the top of the list of Leading Quick-Service Burger Restaurant Chains.
