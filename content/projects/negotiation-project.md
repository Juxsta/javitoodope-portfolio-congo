### Summary
Leslie K. John does a great job at illustrating some of the many aspects lying impacts negotiation. People, including negotiators, lie every day, so, when you’re trying to make a deal, it’s important to defend against deception. According to research conducted in 1999 and 2005, nearly half of people involved in transactions would lie if they had a reason and the chance to do so. In the world of poker and other bluffing games, there's a common belief that you can dependably recognize a liar by looking for tiny behavioral indicators. However, most evidence reveals that that isn’t the case. According to John (2016), “deception is thus one of the intangibles that negotiators have to prepare for and take steps to prevent” (p. 2). People come to a wrong conclusion about a third of the time. The best strategy is to focus not on detecting lies but on preventing them. She outlines five tactics that research has shown to be effective:  

***Encourage Reciprocity***

By offering information, John believes one may create trust and encourage others to provide strategic information. When someone provides sensitive information with us, our natural reaction is to reciprocate. “Reciprocity is particularly pronounced in face-to-face interactions” (John, 2016, p. 3). One will often find that more people are likely to reciprocate when conversing in-person. John also states that people lie less to those they trust compared to when they are dealing with strangers. It's an excellent method to jump-start reciprocity by being the first to reveal a crucial problem because the other person is more likely to share similar information. This strategy also has the advantage of allowing you to frame the negotiation, which can help you uncover more breakthroughs.    

***Ask the Right Questions***

John explains that negotiators frequently deceive by omission, withholding essential information, but if confronted directly, they are more likely to reply truthfully. Many negotiators are more likely to guard sensitive information that could damage their position in the negotiation process. A great example she gives for a situation like this is a business owner looking to sell his business but withholds the information that his equipment needs to be replaced soon because it might hinder the outcome of the negotiation. It is important to recognize how you pose a question. When it comes to pessimistic expectations, John believes people are less inclined to lie than when it comes to optimistic ones. People find it simpler to lie when they confirm an incorrect claim than when they deny a factual one.

***Watch For Dodging***

John talks about how it is important to not allow negotiators to avoid your questions. The negotiator should write them down ahead of time, take notes on the responses, and make sure you obtain the answers you need. Because most forget what they originally asked, negotiators typically do not notice when their questions are being dodged. John also found that people are more impressed by stylish dodging than by pertinent but incoherent responses. When people remember what they have asked, dodge detection is increased. They should keep a list of questions and take time after each response to see if the person actually answered their questions. 

***Don’t Dwell On Confidentiality***  

According to studies mentioned by John, the more you convince individuals that you would preserve their privacy, the more guarded they will become and the more likely they will lie. As a result, remain casual when addressing difficult matters. Often others tend to get nervous and share less of their information. John believes that people are more likely to share sensitive information when they are asked questions in a casual tone rather than a formal one. She also states that it is important to still protect any confidential information one receives.

***Cultivate Leaks*** 

John believes people often divulge information unintentionally, so it’s best to keep an ear out for any slips and try getting information in a different way. John states that information tends to be more accurate when people answer mindlessly. One might use indirect tactics to glean information from the person they are negotiating with. A great example John (2016) provides is “give your counterpart a choice of two different packages–two possible ways of dividing the spoils–both of which would be acceptable to you” (p. 6). If a person expresses a preference, John explains that they are disclosing information about their priorities and providing insight into their relative value of the subjects under discussion. 

#### Relevant Points  
One of the more relevant points John brings up is that normally one cannot detect when someone is lying. The common myth that people have “tells” or signs to which when they are lying is often misconstrued and inaccurate. As stated by Robert S. Adler in his article, “Negotiating with Liars” (2007), “indeed, according to most experiments, the odds of detecting whether someone is lying rarely exceed random chance.” (p. 3). This relates back to when John pointed out that most lie detecting theories are not accurate enough to use those methods wholeheartedly. John states, “One meta-analysis…found that people can correctly identify whether someone is telling a lie only 54% of the time – not much better odds than a coin flip” (2016, p. 2). This illustrates how relying on those lie detecting methods can lead people to falsely believe someone is lying or even be telling the truth. Another study done by Christina Anthony and Elizabeth Cowley (2012) displayed how much the average person would lie when negotiating to ensure they receive the best deal. Research done by Anthony and Cowley shows, “in the lie condition 78% of participants falsely claimed that a favorable yet expired competitor offer was not expired…” (2012, p. 482). People will often omit details to further their position in a negotiation. It is imperative to use the methods she outlined in the article to help deduct whether or not the other person is lying or withholding information from you.

Another one of her relevant points was to “Watch for Dodging”. She makes a great point that, similar to lie detection, our dodging detection is also limited. John (2016) brings up that “we are not naturally gifted at detecting this sort of evasiveness” (p. 3). Her point of having a list of questions ready for the negotiation is a good way to increase dodging detection by ensuring that the other person is actually answering the questions, not just going around them. Often, we can find this dodging from politicians and other people in power. Adler (2007) states it best, “as viewers who watch politicians and public officials on Sunday morning interview shows can attest, there is a real art to responding to questions by changing the subject or answering questions that have not been asked” (p. 3). This exemplifies how individuals in positions of power frequently seek ways to avoid responsibility by engaging in dishonest behavior that makes no promises yet appears to do so. Lying during negotiations may be something that cannot be avoided, and it may be a major hindrance to the creation of value in negotiations. The good news is that employing science-based strategies may aid in bringing out the best in conversations and participants.
 
#### Further Research
***Morality and Legality of Lying***

In certain cases, lying is viewed as morally wrong, and most of the time it is also illegal. Sadly, legal ramifications do not get brought up until after the negotiation has already finished. In his article, Adler states, 
> “Common law fraud requires five simple elements: (1) a false representation of a material fact, (2) knowledge or belief as to its falsity, (3) an intent to induce the other party to rely on the representation, (4) justifiable reliance by the injured party, and (5) damage or injury to the innocent party” (2007, p. 2). 

Based on these elements, one can conclude that unethical bargaining practices can be illegal. It is best to proceed with caution. If one just simply follows those 5 simple elements. They should not have to worry about the legality of their negotiation.

***Background Research***

Conducting background research can help alleviate any misconceptions or misrepresentation that can occur during a negotiation. Knowing who and which company you are speaking with can help you determine whether the person is legitimate enough to speak to. In the article, illustrates how there are three things one can do to help find credibility in the negotiator. The first is to do research. Adler states, “perhaps the quickest way to begin is to run a search through Google, Yahoo or one of the other Internet search engines” (2007, p.5). One can easily figure out whether the company the negotiator is representing is legitimate on the internet. The second is to check with authorities and government agencies to find the credibility of the business. An example of some places to check could be the Better Business Bureau or the Federal Trade Commission. The third is to outright ask the person if the person has references or other clients that could vouch for their legitimacy. Adler states, “some negotiators are uneasy about asking for this information since it indicates that they do not trust the other side” (2007, p. 5). It may depend on how you ask the negotiator. Adler thinks that respectful questioning will generally overcome any unfavorable reaction from a trustworthy opponent.

***Using Contingent Agreements For Protection***

It is best to protect oneself during negotiations just in case something goes awry. Creating contingent agreements can be a great way to protect oneself, and simply mentioning that you intend to include the other party's remarks in the written agreement can sometimes start a more honest conversation. Adler states that one can “insist on a ‘contingency’ provision in the contract that provides specific protection should the representation turn out to be false” (2007, pp. 6-7). It is best to create fail safes just in case the person one negotiated with turns out to be malicious and untrustworthy. These are just three ways that one can protect themselves from potential lying negotiators.
