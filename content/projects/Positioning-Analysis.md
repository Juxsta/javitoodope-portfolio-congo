## PEET’S BACKGROUND 
Peet's Coffee & Tea is a San Francisco Bay area-based specialty coffee roaster and marketer of  fresh roasted whole bean coffee and tea. Founded by Alfred Peet in Berkeley, California, in 1966,  Peet's has established a loyal customer base with strong brand awareness in California. Peet's  dissatisfaction with American coffee inspired him to begin brewing his own coffee. Peet's coffee  originally sold coffee beans, not cups of coffee. His coffee beans were hand-roasted in small  batches and then brewed in small batches to preserve the coffee's freshness. Peet's wanted to bring  better coffee to the American market and earned the nickname "godfather of gourmet coffee in the  U.S." Their coffee is sold under multiple channels of distribution including grocery stores, home  delivery, office, restaurant and foodservice accounts, and Company-owned and operated stores in  six states. This creates two different reportable segments of retail stores and specialty sales. By  2018, Peet’s operates over 200 retail stores in 11 states like California, Washington DC, Virginia,  Tennessee, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Illinois, and Maryland and has expanded to  China, opening a location in Shanghai. By December 2016, Peet's coffee was sold in approximately  14,000 grocery stores, Universities and Wholesalers across the United States. Peet’s today is a  publicly traded company (NASDAQ: PEET). 

## Timeline for Peet’s Coffee: 
**1966:** Arthur Peet opens the first Peet's store in North Berkeley.  

**1970’s:** Peet's opens its second store in Menlo Park. Jerry Baldwin and partners open the first Starbucks outlet in Seattle's Pike Place Market, selling Peet's coffee. They also opened a third store  in Berkeley.    

**1980’s:** Baldwin's group buys Peet's Coffee & Tea and the Peet's owners sell the Starbucks chain  to Howard Schultz.   

**1990’s:** Peet's opens a 60,000-square-foot roastery in Emeryville. In 1995 they opened its first  store outside the Bay Area and they also began to supply Au Bon Pain bakery cafés with coffee.  Moreover, they opened their first store outside northern California, and they opened another store  in Chicago, and took a step into the Boston market.   

**2000’s:** 2007 Peet's opened a roasting plant in Alameda in 2007. In August 2014, Peet's acquired  Mighty Leaf Tea, a specialty tea brand based in the Bay Area, in partnership with Next World  Group. In 2008, Peet’s continued to implement its strategy to expand its multiple distribution  channels throughout the United States of America. They started expanding their distribution in  2008 with 23 new retail stores and entering 2400 new grocery stores mainly outside of the western  core, which helped them grow their grocery store revenue by 23%. Peet's opened its first  international location in Shanghai, China, in October 2017.    

## MARKETING RESEARCH OBJECTIVE 
The US coffee industry is vast, a nearly $27 billion market, and specialty coffee value is $11-12  billion. The growth in specialty coffee is particularly strong in the grocery where specialty coffee  dollars spent in the last year (2020) grew an estimated 12%. The specialty coffee category is highly  competitive but is mostly dominated by Starbucks Corporation, which is larger than all the competitors combined. In the coffeehouse business, Peet’s also competes with Dunkin Donuts, McDonald, and local chains.    

Although Peet’s is old in the coffee business, it does not hold a major share in the market compared  to its competitors like Starbucks. To achieve this goal Peet’s coffee and tea need to analyze its  position in the current market. For this, we conducted a survey to provide Peet’s with hard data on how people currently perceive its product preferences in respect to value, quality, convenience,  cost, environmentally friendly, and user-friendliness, so it can better position its brand in the 21st 
century coffee industry

## RESEARCH PLAN 
The positioning and mapping model is used to conduct our research. “Positioning” in the minds  of customers typically results when an organization follows deliberate strategies to design products  with characteristics distinct from those of its competitors and then communicates these differences  to the targeted customers. The goal of positioning will help the organization to recognize them and  their product superiority in customer minds and also help them to market establish the image or identification of a brand. 

To perform positioning analysis, we used a combination of perceptual (attribute-based data) and  preference (that rely on preference data e.g., rank-orders of brands by customers) mapping. We  used this because both perceptions and preferences influence customer behavior.  

We developed a survey (Appendix Exhibit 1) that looked at customers’ attitudes towards their  brand and also the brands which perceived to be their closest competitors. In our analysis, for  perceptual data to identify product attributes for evaluation, we summarized various generic attributes that provided a useful starting point for selecting our attributes. The attributes which we finalized below:   

|     |     |     |
|----|----|----|
|Taste of the Coffee|Sales Promotions|Home Delivery/ pickup service|
|Variety of Coffee flavors|Loyalty Programs|Drive-Thru Experience|
|Ambiance|Social Media Engagement|Mobile App Experience|
|Location convenience|Sanitation/Overall cleanliness|Wait Time|
|Wi-Fi|COVID-19 Compliance|Customer Service|
|Food Menu|Dietary Preferences|Price|

* The **taste and variety of the coffee flavors** attributes are used to determine the quality of the coffee and the **ambiance, location, convenience & Wi-Fi** attributes help us  understand the structure and accessibility to the coffee shop.  
* **Sales promotion, loyalty programs, and social media** help to understand how competitors  and Peet's retain their customers and bring new business. 
* **Home delivery/pickup service, drive-thru experience, mobile app experience, and wait  time** helps us determine how Peet's are good at approachability compared to its  competitors.  
* **Customer service** attributes enable us to understand the friendliness of their staff and  overall satisfaction.  
* **Sanitation/Overall cleanliness & COVID compliance** helps us discover how neat the store  is. Especially with the COVID situation, the respondents have ranked how Compliance  adheres in the store.
* **Food menu** attributes help us to determine the variety of add-on or quick food options  available. Dietary preferences help us understand various options they have like vegan, keto, different milk options (whole milk,2%, almond, coconut, etc.) compared to its  competitors.
* The **price** attribute helps us to determine competitiveness and affordability.

Perception data was organized into a matrix that represents customer perceptions for each of the prespecified attributes. For example, the coffee shop differs along with many perceptual attributes such as ambience, price, customer services, and so on. Preference score data obtained for each brand from each respondent. Individual-level preference data, measured on a scale from 1 to 9, with higher numbers representing increased preference. 

The data matrix in Exhibit 2 summarizes the perceptions of the respondents, illustrates the nature of the data collected and the range of customer ratings, from 1 (worst) to 9 (best), for each attribute. Exhibit 3 summarizes the preference of the respondent. The data collected from 60 respondents are averaged, which represents the perceptions of the target segment. After collecting data we did positioning analysis in Enginius software.  

## FINDINGS & MARKETING INSIGHTS  
**Figure 1**  
![Dimension Variance](/images/dimensions.jpg)

**Figure 2**  
![Variance Explained](/images/variance-exp.jpg)

From the above Figure 1 and 2, the variance explained by each axis indicates the relative importance of the axis for explaining customer perceptions. Variance explained by Dimension 1 is 57.2%, Dimension 2 is 40.4 % & Dimension 3 is 2.4 %. Since Dimension 1 & 2 cumulatively explain  97.6%, we consider 2 dimensions for our further analysis. Since variance captured by Dimension 1 is 57.2%, it is an important dimension in explaining  customer perceptions. 

The axes of a perceptual map are the dimensions along which customers distinguish the offerings  in a given market. Attributes that are closely aligned to each other provide clues about the meaning  of that axis. 
* **Dimension 1:** Attributes aligned closely are Dietary Preferences, Variety Of Coffee  Flavors, Taste of Coffee, Ambience, Sanitation/Overall Cleanliness. thus we name this         Dimension as ***"Exclusivity"***.
    
    **Exclusivity** because all the closely aligned attributes describe peculiarity each Coffee chain has or can have. 
* **Dimension 2:** Attributes aligned close to axis of Dimension 2 are Mobile App Experience,  Location Convenience, Home Delivery/Pickup Service, Drive Thru Experience, Social  Media Engagement and Sales Promotions , therefore, we name this Dimension as  ***"Reachability"***. 
    
    **Reachability** because the closely aligned attributes describe the reach and the ease with  which consumers have access to buy Coffee. 

## Market perception about Peet’s Coffee & Tea as compared to its competitors: 
**Figure 3**  
2-D Perceptual Map:  
![Perceptual Map](/images/perceptual-map.png)

* Based on the perceptual map (Figure 3), Peet’s Coffee is placed comparatively closer to Dunkin Donuts. 
* The public perception of each of the Coffee Brands under consideration is very distinct from each other as illustrated by the 2-D perpetual map.  
* Starbucks is one of the key players in the Coffee Chains industry and is placed much  farther from Peet’s Coffee & Tea. This implies that people like Peet’s and Starbucks for  different reasons.  
* Peet’s Coffee gets a higher rating for Dietary Preferences, Variety of Coffee Flavors, Taste  of Coffee, Ambience, Sanitation/Overall Cleanliness, which means it is comparatively well  positioned across Dimension 1 as compared to Dimension 2. 
* It also indicates that Peet's Coffee has a distinguishing market image in terms of the Taste  and Variety of its Coffee flavors and also is known to accommodate different dietary  requirements/preferences and also perceived as a clean/neat place. 
* The major competitors for Peet’s Coffee & Tea is Starbucks since these brands have  “Coffee” as their primary focal product. 
* Starbucks is highly ranked in terms of Loyalty Programs, Taste of Coffee, Variety, Mobile  App Experience, Sales promotions. This suggests that Starbucks is observed to be well  positioned along both the Dimensions. It is doing well in terms of Exclusivity and  Reachability. 
* In order to achieve an improved brand perception, Peet’s Coffee & Tea must position it  well firstly, along the “Reachability” Dimension (Dimension 2) and on the "Exclusivity" Dimension (Dimension 1) as well.

**Preference Data:** 
* Based on the preference data (Figure 4 below), we observe that Starbucks and Peet’s tea and  Coffee are close to each other as the top preference. On the other hand, Dunkin Donuts and McDonald’s are much less preferred.

## REPOSITIONING PEET’S COFFEE AND TEA
**Figure 5**  
![Perceptual Map](/images/Picture5.jpg)

* Peet’s Coffee lags significantly behind in terms of Loyalty Programs, Mobile App Experience, Sales promotions, Drive-Thru Experience, Home Delivery/Pickup Service. 
* Peet’s Coffee must reposition itself along the “Reachability” Dimension and also on the  “Exclusivity” Dimension. 
* Since, it has comparatively better recognition with respect to “Exclusivity” it is hence,  important to improve on the “Reachability” dimension primarily. 
* Repositioning itself along the “Reachability” dimension is a relatively viable solution  which can be achieved by employing efficient and well thought marketing strategies. 

## LIMITATIONS 
The responses collected from the questionnaire might be slightly biased as the responses are  confined to friends and family of the team member who majorly reside in the Bay area. The sample  which we used for our analysis was limited to 60 respondents. We could have had a larger sample  size to get better insights. The experience attributes are impacted given the pandemic situation,  since people have not been able to spend time in the Coffee shops. People go to coffee shops for experience, but, due to COVID-19, we have responses where people are preferring drive thru  experience. This Project does not consider segmentation analysis for the focal brand, which is an  important step that helps identify the target market segment. The respondents demographic has not been considered while sending the questionnaire.
 
## MARKETING PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS & INSIGHTS  
**Figure 6**  
![Picture6](/images/Picture6.png)  
We recommend following insights for repositioning Peet’s Coffee with respect to Figure 6: 
* To identify the target segment by conducting market research and focusing on consumer  behavior of the target segment. 
* Peet’s has a comparatively better ranking in regard to “Exclusivity” which means,  customers having more inclination/liking towards specific/specialty taste and variety of  coffee, who are avid coffee drinkers might be a better choice as a target segment. 
* It lags behind in terms of the “Reachability”. If it improves on its reach, it can also be a  choice of Coffee drinkers who majorly care about the ease/convenience of buying coffee. 
* Although, our analysis is focused on Positioning, identifying a target segment using  Segmentation Analysis is highly recommended followed by the Positioning.
* Improving on the advertisement. Devising an effective advertising campaign that would  showcase Peet’s as an exclusive Coffee experience. 
* Devising an attractive slogan/ positioning statement to catch the attention Coffee  connoisseurs / Coffeeholics. 
* Introducing interesting Loyalty Programs can be a good strategy. 
* Improving the Mobile App experience will also be beneficial in attracting customers by  making coffee experience easy and hassle free. User friendly apps have a significant impact  on the user experience and hence is an important factor to consider.  
* Increase its Locations & Drive Thru facilities. On account of COVID 19 restrictions, drive  thru coffee is the most preferred option to buy coffee. 
* Peet’s can promote its brand by providing offers and promotional discounts while also  partnering with local online delivery Apps like Uber Eats, Grubhub, DoorDash (Uber eats,  GrubHub) .This can help to reach more and more customers. 
* Peets can increase their Social Media presence by using influencer marketing, using catchy  hashtags, paid promotions et. 
* Peet’s can formulate attractive combo offers pairing coffee with popular food items on  their menu. 
* Peet’s can market its tea component as well because other competitors (Starbucks,  McDonald’s, Dunkin Donuts) do not really serve Tea.
